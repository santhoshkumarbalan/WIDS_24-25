## General stuff  
[11/12, 12:36 pm] +91 76669 43568: some general instructions:  

1. Create your own GitHub repo for submitting assignments of week 1
2. Share your GitHub repo with me so i can assess your work and give comments
3. You are allowed to use GPT for your assignments, but it'd be better if you didn't (youd appreciate the topic more)
4. Some of the mathematics may seem overwhelming, do use the references provided, especially the SC653 notes
5. I have uploaded research papers for topics we will not be covering, do check those out early on, as you may be required to explain and implement the algorithms on your own for a final project of sorts 
6. For math heavy enthusiasts, do refer to the notes on convex optimisation notes by nesterov, they are quite theoretical and make for an interesting read
7. I will be uploading more research papers with time so you can go through them in your free time
[11/12, 12:43 pm] +91 93819 67834: are you referring to IE684_Lab01 these labs as assignments ???
[11/12, 12:43 pm] +91 76669 43568: yes  

## WEEK 1  

[11/12, 12:43 pm] +91 76669 43568: Instructions for week 1:

1. I have uploaded a reference  for gradient descent and how to write it on python, this is the general format i want you to submit your assignments in 
2. You may skip exercise 1 and 2 of lab 1, but do the rest of the problems for assignment completion  
3. For better mathematical understanding  of gradient descent, read lectures 1 to 3 of the SC653
4. To better understand Newton's method, I've uploaded a reference  

[11/12, 12:59 pm] +91 76669 43568: Week 1 work is due next Wednesday, however if you do find it difficult, please reach out to me on the group (not on dms) that way everyone can get an explanation and better understanding as well  

[11/12, 1:00 pm] +91 76669 43568: if  by chance you do finish the two lab assignments for week 1 earlier, you can either
1. Take a chill pill and relax
2. I can give you problems in combinatorial optimisation
3. Study the mathematics more
